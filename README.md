A living repo for me to learn native script.

Need to globaly install native script cli

```
npm install nativescript -g
```

To check if your environment is setup correctly run:
```
tns doctor
```

You can get native script to setup your environment by running:
```
tns setup
```


Once you have native script installed and the environment setup, cd into the project and run this command to 
install all platforms and dependencies described in the package.json.
```
tns install
```

To run on devices
```
tns run <ios/android>
```
